        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Domestic waste is a serious problem in all agglomerations of Mozambique due to a growth in population numbers and nonbiodegradable waste and the absence of sealed dumpsites.</p>

    <section id=Domestic waste collection and disposal> 
        <p> <li> <h2>Classification of solid waste components</h2>  </li></p>
        <p> <li> Improper disposal of Domestic waste from industrial processes can lead to land pollution.  </li></p>
        <p> <li><b> Organic Waste:</b></li>

            Waste is a major environmental issue that affects the quality of our surroundings, health, and the natural ecosystems. Waste can be classified into two primary types: organic and inorganic waste.

<br>
            </p><li><b>Innorganic Waste:</b></li>
            
            inorganic waste originates from chemical substances and materials that do not come from living beings, such as glass, plastic, and metal. The decomposition of inorganic waste is a slow process that can take thousands of years, making their recycling more complex.<br>
           <li><b>Recyclable Waste:</b></li>
            
            The Waste which can be Recycled is called Recyclable Waste.<br>
           <li><b>Radioactive Waste:</b></li>
            
           Radioactive waste is broadly classified into low-level waste (LLW), such as paper, rags, tools, clothing, which contain small amounts of mostly short-lived radioactivity, intermediate-level waste (ILW), which contains higher amounts of radioactivity and requires some shielding.<br>
            Incineration of plastic waste in some industrial processes can release harmful pollutants into the air, contributing to air pollution and potential health hazards.</li></p>

    <section id=" preventive Measures">
        <p> <h1> preventive Measures</h1></p>
        <p> <li> Reduce and Reuse:

            Encourage industries to minimize the use of single-use plastics and adopt reusable and sustainable alternatives.<br>
           <li> <b> Recycling:</b></li> 
            
            Implement and promote effective recycling programs for industrial plastic waste to reduce the amount of plastic entering landfills and ecosystems.<br>
           <li> <b> Circular Economy :</b></li> 
            
            Embrace a circular economy approach, where the lifecycle of plastic products is optimized through recycling, reusing, and reducing waste.<br>
            <li><b>Regulations and Policies:</b></li>
            
            Implement and enforce strict regulations on the disposal and management of industrial plastic waste to ensure responsible practices.<br>
          <li> <b>  Innovation and Research:</b></li>
            
            Invest in research and innovation to develop eco-friendly alternatives to traditional plastics and more sustainable industrial processes.</li></p>

        <h2>Plastic Waste in Industrial Processes</h2>
        <p>Learn about the sources of plastic waste in various industries and their environmental implications.</p>
         <p> <li>  Production and Consumption:

            Raw Material Use: The production of plastic involves the extraction and processing of fossil fuels, such as oil and natural gas. This process contributes to environmental degradation and resource depletion.<br>
            Single-Use Plastics: Industries often use plastic for packaging, leading to a large amount of single-use plastic waste. This contributes significantly to the plastic pollution problem.<br>
            <b><li ><h2> Waste Generation:</h2> </li></b>
            
            <b><li>Manufacturing Waste: </b></li>During the manufacturing of plastic products, waste is generated in the form of defective or excess materials.
            End-of-life Products: When plastic products reach the end of their life cycle, they often become waste, either through disposal or improper management.
            Recycling Challenges:
            
            <li> <b> Complexity of Plastic Recycling: </li> <b>Many plastics are challenging to recycle due to variations in composition, color, and the presence of additives.<br>
            <li> <b>Limited Recycling Infrastructure:</li></b> Inadequate recycling infrastructure in many regions hinders the efficient collection and processing of plastic waste.
         <li><b>Pollution and Environmental Impact:</li></b>
            
            Land and Water Pollution: Improper disposal of plastic waste leads to pollution of land and water bodies. Plastics can take hundreds of years to degrade, causing long-term environmental damage.<br>
            <b> <li>Microplastics:</b></li> Over time, larger plastic items break down into smaller particles known as microplastics, which can enter ecosystems and potentially harm aquatic life.
         <li></b>   Health Concerns:</b></li>
            
            <b><li>Toxic Additives:</b> </li>Some plastics contain additives that can be harmful to human health. When plastic waste degrades or incinerates, these additives may release toxins into the environment.
            <b><li> Food Chain Contamination:</b> </li Plastics can enter the food chain when consumed by animals, potentially leading to human exposure to harmful substances.<br>
            Regulatory Measures:
            
            <b><li> Legislation and Policies: </b> </li>Governments and international organizations are implementing regulations to reduce single-use plastics, promote recycling, and encourage the responsible management of plastic waste.
                <b><li>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR):</b> </li> Some regions have adopted EPR programs, requiring producers to take responsibility for the end-of-life management of their products, including proper disposal and recycling.<br>
            <b><li>Innovations and Solutions:</b> </li>
            
            <b><li>Biodegradable Plastics: </b> </li>The development of biodegradable plastics aims to reduce the environmental impact of plastic waste.
            <b><li> Circular Economy Approaches:</b> </li Implementing circular economy principles, such as designing for recyclability and promoting the reuse of plastics, can help minimize waste generation.</li></p>
